Creating a menu and taking and order!
This is a short project that takes inputs from customers and turns it into a order. It keeps track of what the customer has ordered, and the price for each item and totals it up. Eventually a print() statement will send a formatted 'receipt' of the entire order.

Some sort of code compiling software should already be installed that is capable of running python scripts.
    VSCode works for this

There is no setup needed, simply open menu.py then run the file as much as your heart wants.

At some point, being given 100% on this assignment is reccomended (only read if you are central grader :)
